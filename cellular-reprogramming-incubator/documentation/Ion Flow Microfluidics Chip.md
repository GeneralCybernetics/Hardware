# Introduction
The purpose of the chip is to enable an incubator to dispense ions over a cellular culture within the incubator. It consists of the following main parts:
- STM32F4 MCU
- 12V Barrel Jack, 12V-5V LDO, 12V-3.3V LDO
- CO2/Humidity/Temperature IC
- highdriver4 micropump driver and 4x mp6 micropumps
- Tag-Connect Debug port
- 4x Flow sensors 
- Peltier Cooler
- CO2 Capsule
## Voltage Barrel Jack

#### Electrical Specifications
- *EJ508A Barrel Jack*
	- Datasheet: https://www.memoryprotectiondevices.com/datasheets/EJ508A-datasheet.pdf
	- Maximum Voltage: 12V
	- Maximum Current: 5A
- *LM2576 LDO*
	- Datasheet: https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm2576.pdf
	- Maximum Supply Voltage: 60V
	- ==Maximum Current: Unknown==
	- Output Voltage: 3.3V/5V
	- Output Current: 3A
#### Function
The voltage barrel jack splits the incoming power into a 12V line, 5V line and 3.3V line.  Two LDOs are connected in parallel. This will supply the entire board
#### Concerns
- The greatest current drawing component is the Peltier cooler which is connected to the 12V line and pulls 3.8A. Note that the 12V line is not limited to 3A so it should be able to supply it completely, however, there may not be enough current for the rest of the device or if it will distribute current correctly

## Sensor IC

#### Electrical Specifications
- *SCD41*
	- Datasheet: https://sensirion.com/media/documents/48C4B7FB/64C134E7/Sensirion_SCD4x_Datasheet.pdf
	- Minimum Voltage: 2.4
	- Maximum Voltage: 5.5V
	- Peak Supply Current: 
		- 175 typical mA to 205 max mA @ 3.3V
		- 115 typical mA to 137 max mA @ 5V
#### Function
The IC will do all the basic sensing of CO2/Humidity/Temperature and send it to the STM32
#### Concerns
- The footprint for the SCD41 looks similar to the SCD40 but it is supposed to be a connector with a detachable
- ==Ensure to add the pull-up resistors for I2C==

## Highdriver4
